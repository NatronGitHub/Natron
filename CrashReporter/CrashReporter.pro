# The binary name needs to be Natron as this is what the user lauches
# It is renamed during deployment
TARGET = NatronCrashReporter
VERSION = 2.0.0
TEMPLATE = app

# NatronCrashReporter is built as an app to make debugging easier:
# - on Linux and OSX, make a symbolic link to the Natron binary
#  (which is inside Natron.app on OSX) next to the NatronCrashReporter binary
#  example on OSX:
#  $ cd build/Debug/NatronCrashReporter.app/Contents/MacOS
#  $ ln -s ../../../../../../App/build/Debug/Natron.app/Contents/MacOS/Natron Natron-bin
