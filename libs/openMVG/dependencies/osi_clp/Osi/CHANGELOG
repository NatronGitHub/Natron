02/02/2013 OsiUnitTest
  - replace macro for asserting a condition and collecting its outcome by a function
    to improve compilation speed (contributed by Victor Zverovich)

29/11/2012 OsiMsk
  - added getRescode() to get result code of last MSK_optimize call

21/11/2012 OsiCpx
  - calling setWarmStart with a too small basis now disables the use of an
    advanced basis for the next LP solve

20/11/2012 OsiGlpk, OsiCpx
  - workaround problem in Glpk with empty problem name (patch by Bertrand Le Cun)
  - not using CPXsolninfo for MIPs with CPLEX < 11.0 anymore

25/07/2012 OsiGrb
  - fix mipstart option in OsiGrb: pass only values for discrete variables to Gurobi

26/11/2011 OsiGrb
  - add implementation of OsiGrb::applyCuts that batches the row cuts before transfering them to Gurobi

12/11/2011 OsiSpx
  - add resolve with cleared basis if solve fails with exception (which may be due to a singular startbasis),
    needs SoPlex >= 1.5.0.7

03/09/2011 OsiMsk
  - fix bug in one loadProblem method when NULL was passed as row range array

30/07/2011 Osi
  - fix writing LP files with names: the objective name was not copied, leading to a segfault in CoinLpIO

30/07/2011 OsiSpx, OsiGlpk
  - allow NULLs for row* arguments in some loadProblem call

28/07/2011 OsiSpx
  - invert dual ray in getDualRays to match Osi definition when testing infeasibility proof

25/06/2011 Osi
  - add generic implementations of is{Primal,Dual}ObjectiveLimitReached

25/06/2011 OsiCommonTest
  - add unittest command line parameter -onerror to specify behaviour in case of a failing test 

23/06/2011 OsiMsk
  - add isLicenseError() to check whether last solve was abandoned due to a mosek licensing issue 

22/06/2011 OsiCpx
  - fix handling of primal/dual objective limit so it correctly takes objoffset into account
  - preserve objective sense also when empty model is loaded
  - make sure getWarmStart returns proper atlower/atupper status for inequalities

13/06/2011 OsiCommonTest, unittest
  - removed now redundant counting of unittest failures, so test functions now return void 

03/06/2011 OsiMsk
  - fix caching flags (bitwise negation is ~, not !)
  - free all cached data when loading problem
  - fix getDualRay and getPrimalRay so they should return a ray now 
  - fixed various further issues in unittest, so OsiMsk passes it now

15/05/2011 OsiXpr
  - added option (mipstart) to pass column solution as initial solution to a MIP solve

30/04/2011 OsiCpx, OsiGrb
  - added option (mipstart) to pass column solution as initial solution to a MIP solve

29/04/2011 OsiMsk
  - fix loss of Mosek task when copying OsiMsk

25/04/2011 OsiSpx
  - add methods to set/get/check timelimit
  - fix bug in solve methods where cached result vectors where not cleared
  - fix setWarmStart to swap status for slack variables as in getWarmStart
  - fix caching flags (bitwise negation is ~, not !)

  - getColSolution and getObjValue now return lower bound and value in lower bound before solve

01/04/2011 OsiGlpk
  - if initial basis is invalid or singular in initialSolve or resolve,
    construct advanced basis and try again

31/03/2011 OsiGrb
  - fixed handling of free variables in setWarmStart

30/03/2011 OsiGrb
  - fixed memory leak in loadProblem

21/03/2011 OsiCommonTest, unittest
  - add classes TestOutcome{s} to collect outcome of unittests
  - add macros to simplify asserts and exception catching and storing results as TestOutcome
  - change general and OsiGlpk tests to use new macros
