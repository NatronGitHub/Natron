description         SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec \
                    library
long_description    libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD \
                    instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON) to accelerate \
                    baseline JPEG compression and decompression on \
                    x86, x86-64, and ARM systems. On such systems, \
                    libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as \
                    libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of \
                    systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform \
                    libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its \
                    highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many \
                    cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals \
                    that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.
