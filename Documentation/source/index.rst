Natron documentation
====================

The Natron documentation is organized as follows:

- The :ref:`user-guide` contains everything to get started with Natron, including tutorials.
- The :ref:`reference-guide` contains the documentation about the user settings and environment variables for Natron, as well as the documentation for each node in Natron.
- The :ref:`developers-guide` contains documentation about using the Python scripting language within Natron, and using the Natron command-line interface (a.k.a. NatronRenderer).
