This chapter will guide your through the installation and maintenance of Natron on Windows.

Requirements
------------

Natron will work on Windows 7, 8.x, 10 with latest updates.

The basic requirements are:

 * x86 compatible CPU (Core2 x86_64 or higher recommended)
 * OpenGL 2.0 or higher with the following extensions:
    * **GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two** *(Viewer and OpenGL rendering)*
    * **GL_ARB_shader_objects** *(Viewer and OpenGL rendering)*
    * **GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object** *(Viewer and OpenGL rendering)*
    * **GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object** *(Viewer and OpenGL rendering)*
    * **GL_ARB_vertex_array_object** or **GL_APPLE_vertex_array_object** *(OpenGL rendering only)*
    * **GL_ARB_framebuffer_object** or **GL_EXT_framebuffer_object** *(OpenGL rendering only)*
    * **GL_ARB_texture_float** *(OpenGL rendering only)*

If you don't have the minimum required OpenGL extensions we provide a Software OpenGL solution, install the package *Software OpenGL* from the installer. If you have the portable ZIP file copy *bin\\mesa\\opengl32.dll* to *bin\\*.

Download
--------

Maintenance
-----------

Natron includes a maintenance tool called 'NatronSetup', with this application you can easily upgrade Natron and it's components when a new version is available. You can also add or remove individual packages, or remove Natron completely. The application should be in the same start menu folder as Natron, or you can start it from the folder where you installed Natron.
