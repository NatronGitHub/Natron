Loading images and video
========================


To load an image or a video 
(video is not recommended, see this section: :doc:`how to convert videos to image sequences <tutorials-imagesequence>`
) simply drag'n'drop it to the node graph or add a read node from the toolbar and select your file from the dialog.


.. image:: _images/compositing-Read_node00.png

In the properties panel you see the file path of your added file.
If you click the small folder, you are able to load another file or set it to a file sequence:

.. image:: _images/compositing-Read_node01.png


.. image:: _images/compositing-Read_node02.png

If you edited your image in another tool and now want to refresh its appearance in Natron, click the small recycling sign next to the folder sign.
