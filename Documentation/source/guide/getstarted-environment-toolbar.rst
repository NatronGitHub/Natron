Using the toolbar
=================

Each icon in the toolbar is a menu giving access to different categories of nodes (ie. image processing tools) that Natron offers to process or create images.

If you click on a tool, the corresponding node will be added to the node graph

.. note::  If a node is selected in the graph, the new node will be inserted below the selected one. It will be processed right after the selected one.

Image tools
------------
The nodes to bring images in and out of Natron, plus a few utility nodes.

See :doc:`the Image nodes section<thenodes-image>`

Draw tools
-----------
The nodes to create basic shapes.

Time tools
-----------
The nodes to change the timing of your clips.

Channels tools
---------------
The nodes to changes the order of your image channels (basic channels are RGBA for Red Green Blue Alpha but others can be added).

Colors tools
-------------
Mainly color correction nodes.

Filter tools
-------------
Nodes to change the texture of the image (blur or sharpen for
example).

Merge tools
-----------
Nodes with multiple inputs that can merge multiple images into
one composite image.

Transform tools
---------------
Nodes to change the geometry of the images.

Views tools
------------
Nodes to manage stereo images that considered as different views (left and right).

Other tools
------------
Mainly utility nodes to keep the node graph clean and readable.

.. note::  Other entrys in the toolbar can be added with plugins / scripts. So your Natron installation may have other Tool icons (community plugins,...)
