/** @class This class describes the rectangle (or portion) of an image that is contained
 * into a texture. x1,y1,x2,y2 are respectively the image coordinates of the left,bottom,right,top
 * edges of the texture. w,h are the width and height of the texture. Note that x2 - x1 != w
 * and likewise y2 - y1 != h , this is because a texture might not contain all the lines/columns
 * of the image in the portion defined.
