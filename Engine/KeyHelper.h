/** @brief Helper class that represents a Key in the cache. A key is a set
 * of 1 or more parameters that represent a "unique" element in the cache.
 * To create your own key you must derive this class and provide a HashType.
 * The HashType is a value that will serve as a hash key and it will be computed
 * the first time the getHash() function is called.
 * If you need to notify the cache that the key have changed, call resetHash()
 * and the next call to the getHash() function will compute the hash for you.
 *
 * Thread safety: This function is not thread-safe itself but it is used only
 * by the CacheEntryHelper class which itself is used only by the cache which
 * is thread-safe.
 *
 * Important: In order to compile this class must be boost::serializable, see
 * FrameEntry.h or Image.h for an example on how to serialize a KeyHelper instance.
 *
 * Maybe should we move this class as an internal class of CacheEntryHelper to prevent elsewhere
 * usages.
